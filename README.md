## Description
You start in the Vehicle Assembley Building (VAB) with a pre-assembled rocket which you can edit to your liking or scrap entirely.

You can place a part by hovering over where you want to place it and using the scroll wheel to select a part then placing it with left click. Once you are happy with your rocket you can press M to go to the launch pad.

From there you can press or hold W to thrust your engines and blastoff or use A and D to rotate the craft while in the air. You can also use the scroll wheel to zoom or press M to switch beteen map and rocket view.
